                    I firmly believe that it is the best path for me, and my decision was not due to any limitations in my grades. My goal is to learn through practical 
                    work experience, courses, and certifications, and vocational training provides an excellent opportunity to quickly access the job market. I am aware
                    that there is a lot of competition, which is why I will strive to distinguish myself through hard work and by continually acquiring new knowledge 
                    throughout my career.

                            <h4>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
                            <p> It consists of 17 modules and 2000 hours of training, divided into 2 years of study, covering a bit of everything: programming, databases, web, 
                                hardware, but mainly focusing on systems administration and networks. Therefore, it provides extensive and somewhat general knowledge in areas 
                                such as application or web development, but a deeper focus on the security, management, and administration of both computer systems and networks.
                                It includes more than 300 hours of training in work centers (internship). In addition, my program is part of the ILE ("Impulso Lenguas Extranjeras") 
                                program, which means that I receive some subjects in English.

                            <p> It consists of 15 modules and 2000 hours of training, divided into 2 years of studies. It is similar to the Higher Education. The modules include programming, web, hardware, 
                                systems, and networks, but they are not as in-depth as those in Higher Education. Personally, it was very useful for me as an introduction and familiarization with the field of computer science.
                                <br><br>
                                I believe that starting a Higher Education with the knowledge base gained from this VET Studies is much better. This way, you do not start from scratch 
                                but build upon the already established base.
